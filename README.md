Car Prediction
In this project, we embarked on a comprehensive journey through the world of data science and machine learning using a car dataset. We learned the importance of preparing data by encoding categorical variables, feature scaling numerical variables and converting columns to suit our needs. Three regression algorithms - Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest - were employed to predict car prices, and their performance was evaluated using the metric Mean Squared Error (MSE). We found that Random Forest performed the best. We then trained another Random Forest model in which we took into account the car names this time by one hot encoding them. We then discovered that this improved performance over the previous model. Data visualization played a pivotal role throughout while gaining insights and comparing model performance.
